    This package contains the versions of the ONEDSPEC and RV packages
modified to support tabular spectra.  To avoid confusion with package
loading, these packages are renamed XONEDSPEC and XRV respectively.

Important directories include:

    lib			Package library.  Changes to the noao$lib files
			have been merged.
    src/mwcs		MWCS library source.  Changes from the v2.16 
			sys$mwcs have been merged into source, but this
			'mwcs' library is not installed in the dev IRAF.
    src/xonedspec	ONEDSPEC package source.
    src/xrv		RV package source.

The SPTABLE package will not yet build completely due to work still required
in the package code.  Additionally the 'mwcs' library is in a custom version
of libex.a, this is considered temporary until the sys$mwcs library is
updated.
